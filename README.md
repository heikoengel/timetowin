# Time to WIN

https://heikoengel.github.io/timetowin

*Time to WIN* calculates the total time from a given list of time ranges, automatically subtracting breaks:

* 15 min between 9:15 and 9:30
* 30 min between 12:00 and 13:00.

Timestamps are expected in the format `hh:mm`, or `now` for the current time. Timestamps and ranges have to be ordered in time.

All calculations are done in the browser, no input data is sent to remote servers.
